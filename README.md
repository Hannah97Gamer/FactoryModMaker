# FactoryModMaker

This is a slowly being developed graphical mod making program for the game Factorio, made by Wube Software. The program is not currently in a working state.

The purpose of this program is to provide an easy-to-use GUI to make basic mods for Factorio.

Future plans include a GUI to create the following:
- Recipes
- Technologies
- Items
- Fluids

Adding anything more complicated than those are beyond my current skill level.

If you would like to help out with this project, please feel free to contact me!
